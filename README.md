# Hackathon-Dart

I have three tasks that I had to achieve so I'll just list and explain them briefly:

Task 1: Palindrome Checker Task
The task is to write a Dart function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome. The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and be case-insensitive. Bonus Points: Extend the function to check palindrome properties for numeric inputs as well. Objective: Test string manipulation, logic implementation, and handling edge cases.
A palindrome is like a word, phrase, or number that “runs back” on itself. This bit of wordplay is not the same thing as when you rearrange the letters of a word or phrase to spell another one.

Task 2: Sorting Algorithm Implementation Task
I've used Bubble sort and Quick sort to sort a list of integers. The function returns the sorted list and Implements two different sorting algorithms and compare their performance in terms of execution time. Of which Ive learnt that quick sort is favourable for small inputs, it is the best algorithm When you don’t need a stable sort and average-case performance matters more than worst-case performance, its good For small inputs, quicksort is the best algorithm as compared to the merge sort. When you don’t need a stable sort and average-case performance matters more than worst-case performance, go for quicksort. And bubble sort, This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case complexity are of Ο(n²) where n is the number of items

Task 3: Basic Calculator Function Task
Implement a Dart function that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator (+, -, *, /, %) as input and returns the calculated result. The function should handle basic arithmetic operations. Bonus Points: Extend the function to handle multi-step operations and include error handling for division by zero.
